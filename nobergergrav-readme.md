This project aims to develop a comprehensive time and reporting system tailored to the needs of Noberger. The initial phase of development has focused on establishing the foundational structure of the application, including the backend framework and data models.

## ðŸš§ Development Progress

Here's a breakdown of the development steps completed so far:

- **ASP.NET Core Setup:** The project was initiated by learning how to create an ASP.NET Core application from the ground up.

- **Data Modeling:** Core data models have been created to represent the key entities within the system. This includes models for:
    - **Projects:** Defining the structure and attributes of projects that will be tracked.
    - **Time Reporting:** Establishing the schema for recording time entries, including details such as associated project, date, duration, and user.

- **Database Management with Migrations:** Entity Framework Core (EF Core) migrations have been utilized to generate the necessary database schema based on the defined models.

- **Layout Adjustments:** Initial adjustments to the application's layout have been made. This involves setting up the basic user interface structure, including navigation and overall visual presentation.

- **Admin Page Implementation (In Progress):** Currently, development is focused on creating an administrative interface. This  component will ensure that unauthorized access to the system is prevented. The admin page will include features for user management and role assignment.

- **Exploration of Hosting Services:** Research into suitable hosting services that meet the customer's requirements is underway.
